Some notes
- we use whatsapp to communicate quickly with group members but use discord for video calls when we cannot meet in person or need to pair program
- we use issues in github to keep track of what needs to be completed 
- we meet frequently in person to check in on our tasks and make sure we are all on the same page
- we keep in touch over whatsapp to make sure we are all communicating
- we write documentation on overleaf for some reports but keep the project related documents in github using markdown files
