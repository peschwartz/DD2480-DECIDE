1. What is it
2. What does it do
3. How does it work
4. Grant the right to use it
5. Don't change it

## Tasks for this assignment
- Create a good README
- Write a statement of contributions for each team member
- Program should be functionally correct
- Program should be appropriately tested, with at least one unit test per LIC, and at least 2 tests (positive and negative) if applicable. WHAT SHOULD WE USE FOR TESTING? jUnit?
- Collaboration is well structured and traceable
- every commit is an atomic bug fix or feature with a clear commit message, including an appropriate commit prefix (feat, fix, doc, refactor)
- every commit reflects the commit message, and the fix or feature always has or modifies a test
- Commits are balanced among group members
- Assess and document in one paragraph our way of working

For P+
- most recent 25 commits are linked to an issue
- we have done something remarkable and mention it in our statement of contributions

## Things to do
- Decide the language, unit testing framework, and talk about strengths/weaknesses. 
- Create issues for implementing the README, DECIDE functions/features and assign them to team members on Github
- Remember to: add functionality AND tests, make clear commit messages, communicate with group members for help
- Set up a timeline for finishing issues, integrating features, and completing the assignment

## Statement of Contributions
List each person and a description of their contributions.
